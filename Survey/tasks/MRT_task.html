            Participants had 2.5 minutes to solve 8 Mental Rotation Tasks.
            Each task included a shape and 3 alternatives.
            Participants had to mentally rotate the shapes to find the one alternative that is identical to the shape. <br>
            <br>
            Below is an example Mental Rotation Task: <br>
