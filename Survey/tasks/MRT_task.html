        <p>
            In this task, participants had 2.5 minutes to solve 8 "Mental Rotation Task" (MRT) questions. <br> 
            Each MRT question included a shape that had to be mentally rotated and compared to 3 alternatives.  <br>
            
            Below is an example MRT question: <br>

        Each correct answer gave one point. <br>
        <br>

           <strong> Do you think, on average, men or women performed better? How large, do you think, the performance difference is, in percentage points?</strong>
