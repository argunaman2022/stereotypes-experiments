            Counting Letters

        <p>
            Participants had 3 minutes to solve as many tasks as possible.
            In each task, they had to count the number of times a certain letter appears in a sequence of 50 letters. <br>
            <br>
            In the example below, the correct answer is 4, since there are 4 <strong>C</strong>s. <br>

           <strong> Do you think, on average, men or women performed better? How large, do you think, the performance difference is?</strong>
