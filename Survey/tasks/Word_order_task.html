        <p>
            Participants had 4 minutes to solve as many <strong>Word Order tasks</strong> as possible.
            In each task, they were given a sentence consisting of 5 words in a scrambled order. To score a point, they needed to report the correct order of these words. <br>
            <br>
            In the example below the correct order is: <strong>"4-1-3-2-5"</strong> which translates to "The weather is fine today". <br>

            <strong> Do you think, on average, men or women answered more questions correctly? If the average person answered 10 questions correctly, how large do you think the difference is?</strong>
