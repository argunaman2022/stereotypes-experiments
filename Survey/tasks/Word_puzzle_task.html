            Word Puzzle Task
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            Participants had 2 minutes to answer as many Word Puzzle Tasks as possible. In each task, they had to form as many words as possible using letters from a given box of letters. The letters had to be on a straight line (leftward, rightward, upward or downward).  <br>
            <br>
            For instance, in the example below two of possible answers are "TIGER" (last line, rightwards) and "BEAR" (third line, leftwards). <br>
