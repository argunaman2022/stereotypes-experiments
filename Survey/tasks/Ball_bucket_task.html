            Throwing Balls in a Bucket
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            In this task, participants were given a number of tennis balls to throw into a small basket which was placed 10 feet away.  <br>
            Each successful throw earned one point. <br>           
            <br>
            <strong> Do you think, on average, men or women scored more points? If the average person scored 10 points, how large do you think the difference is?</strong>        </p>
