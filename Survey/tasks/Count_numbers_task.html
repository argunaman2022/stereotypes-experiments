        </h3>
    
        <p>
            In this task, participants had 1.5 minutes to solve as many questions as possible. In each question, they had to count the number of ones in a 5x5 matrix. <br>
            In the example below the correct answer is <strong>12</strong>  since there are twelve <strong>1</strong>s in the matrix.<br>

           <strong> Do you think, on average, men or women performed better? How large, do you think, the performance difference is, in percentage points?</strong>
