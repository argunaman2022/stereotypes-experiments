        <p>
            In this task, participants had 15 minutes to solve as many mazes as possible. <br>
            In each maze, participants had to move the pointer, using the arrow keys on the keyboard, to the ending point. <br>
            <br>
            Below is an example question: <br>

            <strong> Do you think, on average, men or women performed better? How large, do you think, the performance difference is, in percentage points?</strong>
