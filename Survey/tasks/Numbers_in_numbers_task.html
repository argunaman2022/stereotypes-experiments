        <p>
            Participants had 2 minutes to solve as many Number in Number Tasks as possible. In each task, there was a long number of 15 digits and a target number of 3 digits. Using the digits of the long number, participants needed to find as many summations as possible that add up to the target number. The summation had to consist of at most 3 numbers of which each could be either 2 or 3 digits.<br>
            <br>
            In the example below, two possible solutions are <strong>101 + 34</strong> (=135) and <strong>11 + 51 + 73</strong> (=135). <br>

            <strong> Do you think, on average, men or women answered more questions correctly? If the average person answered 10 questions correctly, how large do you think the difference is?</strong>
