    Your answer was incorrect. Please read the instructions again and try to answer the question correctly. You have <strong>one attempt</strong> left.
</p>

<p> To be able to start the study and be eligible for payment, you must read the following examples and answer the subsequent question correctly. Note that you have <strong>two attempts</strong>.
    In all the examples below and the comprehension question, assume that there is the same number of people in both groups.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example 1.</strong>  In Task 1, the average person answered 10 questions correctly. Group A performed better than group B: on average, group A answered 12 questions correctly.
    This means that group B must have answered only 8 questions correctly, since the average person, taking both groups together, answered 10 questions correctly.</p>
    <strong>Example 2.</strong>  In Task 2, group B performed better than group A: on average, group B answered 10.5 questions correctly while group A answered 9.5 questions correctly.
    Therefore, taking both groups together, the average person answered 10 questions correctly.</p>
    <strong>Example 3.</strong>  In Task 3, the average person answered 10 questions correctly. Group A and B did equally well: they both, on average, answered 10 questions correctly.
    This means that group A answered 0 questions more than group B.</p>
