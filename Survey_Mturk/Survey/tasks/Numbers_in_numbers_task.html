        <p>
            In this task, participants had 2 minutes to solve as many questions as possible. In each question, there was a big number and they needed to find as many summations consisting of at most 3 numbers of which each can be a number of 2 or 3 digits.<br>
            In the example below, two possible solutions are <strong>103 + 14</strong> (=117) and <strong>14 + 43 + 60</strong> (=117). <br>

            The more solutions they found, the more points they earned. <br>
            <br>
           <strong> How many more points do you think men (women) answered correctly, compared to women (men)? [in percentage points].</strong>
