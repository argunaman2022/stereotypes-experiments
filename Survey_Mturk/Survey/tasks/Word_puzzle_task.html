            In this task, participants had 2 minutes to answer as many questions as possible. In each question, they had to find as many words as possible in a box with rows and columns of letters.
            Below, is an example of such a matrix:
        
            <img src="pictures/" > <br>
            The more words they found, the more points they earned. 
      
            
           <strong> How many more points do you think men (women) earned, compared to women (men)? [in percentage points].</strong>
