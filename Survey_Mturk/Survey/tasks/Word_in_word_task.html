            In this task, participants had 2 minutes to solve as many questions as possible. In each question, there was a big word and they needed to find as many words as possible by rearranging the letters in the word. <br>

            In the example below two possible answers are "<strong>live</strong>" and "<strong>persuasive</strong>". <br>

            The more words they found, the more points they earned. <br>
            <br>
           <strong> How many more points do you think men (women) earned, compared to women (men)? [in percentage points]</strong>
