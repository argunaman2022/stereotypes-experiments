        <p>
            In this task participants had to solve as many questions as possible. In each question, there was a big word (e.g. Persuasively) and they needed to find as many words as possible by rearranging the letters in the word (e.g. live, persuasive.)

            Below is an example
        
            <img src="pictures/" > <br>
            The more words they found the more points they earned.
            
           <strong> How many more points do you think men (women) earned, compared to women (men)? [in percentage points].</strong>
