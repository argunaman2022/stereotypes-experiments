        <strong>Your Task</strong> <br>

        In this HIT you will be shown 10 different tasks that have been used in previous studies.
        For each of these 10 tasks we ask you to make an educated guess on <strong>how the average performance of men compare to the average performance of women</strong>. <br>
        <br>
        In each question you will first see a description of the task. When you are ready to answer press the <strong>"I am ready to answer"</strong> button.
        Then submit your answer into the box that will appear using the <strong>"Next"</strong> button. <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Earnings</strong> <br>
        After the last question, you will see your total earnings which consist of two components. First, you receive a completion fee of 0.5 USD.  <br>
        Second, one of the 10 questions will be randomly chosen as a bonus payment. The closer your answer to the true value in the chosen question, the higher your bonus payment
        (for an exact description of the bonus payment rule click <button type="button" id="myBtn" onclick="button_click()"> here </button>).

            Your bonus payment is determined according to the following function: <br>
            "Bonus payment" = max(0, 2USD - abs("your answer" - "true value")*0.075USD). <br>
            So if your answer is exactly correct you earn 2USD as a bonus payment. <br>
            If your answer is 10% above or below the true value your bonus payment is 1.25USD.
