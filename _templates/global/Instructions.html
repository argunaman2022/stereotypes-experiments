        <strong>Your Task</strong> <br>
        In this HIT you will be shown 10 different tasks that have been used in previous studies. Each task was run on a different set of people.
        For each of these tasks we ask you to make an educated guess on how the average performance of men compares to the average performance of women.
        <strong>The closer your answer to the true value, the higher your bonus payment.</strong> <br>
        <br>
        In each question you will first see a description of the task. When you are ready to answer press the <strong>"I am ready to answer"</strong> button.
        Then submit your answer into the box that will appear using the <strong>"Next"</strong> button. <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Earnings</strong> <br>
        After the last question, you will see your total earnings which consist of two components. First, for completing the HIT you receive a <strong>reward</strong> of 0.5 USD.  <br>
        Second, one of the 10 questions will be randomly chosen to determine your <strong> bonus </strong> payment. If, for instance, your answer to the randomly selected question is exactly correct, you will earn a bonus of 2 USD.
        If your answer to the randomly selected question is 10% off the true value, you will earn a bonus of 1.6 USD
        (for an exact description of the bonus payment rule click <a id="myBtn"  onclick="button_click()"  style="color:blue; cursor:pointer" > here</a>).
